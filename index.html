            <h1>WELCOME!</h1>
            <h3>My name is Iqra fathima</h3>
            <h5> GET TO KNOW ME</h5>
            <p>HI!, im Iqra Fathima , a 14 yr old who is passionate about a lott of things<br>I have a bunch of hobbies , most of which are pretty cozy , some are intense and some are ...well..unordinary, i would say.My favorite thinges to do as of now are crocheting,Painting,reading,Muning and my latest love -Essay/writing .<br>
        I have been extremely fortunate to have won a commendation and a 850$ scholarship in the John Locke Essay competition 2025 in the category of psychology.<br> I had lived in Dubai for around 9 years with my family and was born in saudi ,however , my parents are from india . In april 2024 , we relocated back to india, though it is a beautiful country ,as someone who lived abroad ,i faced a lot of challenges,the one thing that heped me throughout this was writing essays and reading my comfort books.When i wrote for the competition , it was just to keep me occupied , i didnt realy expect anything from it either. But honestly one of my best experiances and though it got stressful as the deadline appoached , it was worth every single minute.And this is when my love for writing bloomed fully </p> 
        <p>Another one of my more technical hobbies is MUNing.For anyone who doesnt know, MUN(model united nationa) is a simulation of a un body/commitee.In a mun you'll be assigned a portfolio (country, person etc) and youwoukd represent thoughts as the country on the basis of the given agenda.I love debate , so for me mun is really fun, my favourite committee to represent is probably UNGA or UNSC.To all those reading this , try mun , it may be a bit confusing but it is soooo fun (especilally if u have crisis,press conferences etc).</p>
        <H6> ABOUT ME</H6>
        <p> I have been a person with very high goals in life lol. For me , my dream is to study medical sciences and somehow use my career in the feild of international relations i guess . For me ,helping people in any way that i can has been my number 1 priority and it will always be .I enjoy medical sciences a lot cus im a science geek ,not only that but it is a crucial part of the humanity that is prevalent in our societies today. Doctors,nurses,and anyone who takes a small part in this field has probably helped to save over a 1000 lifes . And that is why i wanna be a part of somethig that truly helps.</p><p>thats it i guess, bye bye fellow humans </p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/67/5f/19/675f193245a10299f284edaeb114480a.jpg">
